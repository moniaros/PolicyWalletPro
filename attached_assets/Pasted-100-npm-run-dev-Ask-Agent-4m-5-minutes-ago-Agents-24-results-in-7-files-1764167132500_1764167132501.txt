Act as a world class AI insurance underwriter.
You want to provide the app users with the option to have to fill in information on their user profile. This data should include details that would allow you to identify insurance gaps, visible on each policy along with proposals to add or drop coverages that are missing and would help them live a risk free and stress free life.
Some of the proposed covergae may require underwriting (for that they need to request a quote (will be send to their insurance agent) for others, they can proceed and choose a monthly, 6month or yearly plan and buy it using their credit card.
